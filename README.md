 Get users comfortable with your team before they ever schedule an appointment.

### More Control

Appointments+ is easy to set up, but there’s more under the hood than you might think! Add an unlimited number of employees, partners and contractors as providers. Give them bio pages and display their schedule so clients can choose a provider that fits their need.

 Make services and providers location specific so clients can sort availability by service, time, location and provider. 

### Streamline Scheduling

Our simple 3 click process is configured to allow visitors to set an appointment without forcing visitors to create a user. Your time is valuable. Collect payments or take deposits through PayPal without any additional code or plugins.

## Usage

For help and information on installing plugins you can view our [Installing WordPress Plugins Manual](https://premium.wpmudev.org/manuals/wpmu-manual-2/installing-regular-plugins-on-wpmu/). Check out this [extensive tutorial on building your first Appointments based site](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/build-an-amazing-appointments-website/). Or, watch our video tutorial series:

#### Appointments + Video Tutorials

Once you Activate the plugin you will see a menu appear on the Menu Bar labeled **Appointments**. [

![Appointments Menu](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/1-Appointmetns-Menu.png "Appointments Menu")

 You will see three sub-menus appear when you click on the menu item.  We will tackle each separately and in order. [

![Appointments Submenu](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2-Appointments-Submenu1.png "Appointments Submenu")

##### Appointments

Clicking **Appointments** brings you to the hub of your appointments list.  You will see that your appointments will be separated by status: Active, Pending, Completed and Removed.  You can view each by clicking on their respective links, and each page will show the Client and Service basic info as below.  At the top of the page you will see an Add New button, just like you use to create a new page or post.  Click that and you can Add a new appointment manually to your calendar. [

![Add New Appointment](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/3-Add-New.png "Add New Appointment")

The New Appointment Menu is pretty self explanatory.  There is a place for the client's infomation, the Service information (that will populate from the menus you fill in later) and a place for notes.  Last but not least you can set the status before Saving.  _There is a built in tutorial that covers this as well, I will show you where to find that, just in-case you have any questions or forget something._ [

![Add New Meta](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/4-Add-New-Meta.png "Add New Meta")

 next up...

##### Transactions

Here you will see your transactions if you are taking payments or deposits.  These are also grouped: Recent, Pending and Future.  Each accessible by clicking their respective links.  You cannot manually add a transaction, the plugin will only record what is recorded through PayPal. [

![Transactions](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/5-Transactions.png "Transactions")

 And now the meat of this beast...

##### Settings

The **Settings** menu will greet you with a Tutorial.  You should pay attention to that :) It will tell you what you need to know about setting up the plugin and the tabs you see here.  Most are pretty easy to understand and the plugin options are very well annotated, so you should have no trouble.  We can pop through and summarize them here, one by one, but I will draw your attention to the FAQ tab first. [

![Settings Menu](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6-Settings-Menu.png "Settings Menu")

##### FAQ

Here is where you will find info on everything you need in this plugin, ready for immediate access!   The TWO most important pieces of information on this page, for those who are just installing or learning how to use the plugin, are the two links at the top.  These will start (or restart) the tutorials on the Settings menu options and Entering and Editing Appointments. [

![FAQ](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/7-FAQ.png "FAQ")

 Now, let's backtrack.  Starting off at the first tab:

##### General

These settings are the heart and soul of your setup.  Pay special attention to the General Settings box at the top of the page.  Especially the Time base value.  _Time Base the most important parameter of Appointments+. It is the minimum time that you can select for your appointments._ Everything time related will work off of this value.  The remaining boxes allow you to set your

*   Display: create an appointment page, it's display, client information boxes and a place to add Custom CSS.
*   Client Accessibility: you can choose whether or not to require login before scheduling
*   Payment Settings: choose whether you will accept payments
*   Notification Settings: option to set up confirmation and reminder emails for client and/or providers
*   Performance Settings: Caching options

[

![General Settings](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/8-General1.png "General Settings")

##### Working Hours

Set your hours of operation and Break Times.  Think Business Hours and '_Out to Lunch_'.  You can even specify different hours for different service providers.  Makes it easy to keep track of differing schedules! [

![Working Hours](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/9-Working-Hours.png "Working Hours")

##### Exceptions

Days off, holidays, scheduled maintenance, etc.  You can add them all here.  You can also define working days that are normally non-work days (i.e. a particular Sunday).  These are also able to be set per service provider. [

![Exceptions](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/10-Exceptions.png "Exceptions")

##### Services

What do you do?! What do you provide?!  This is where you lay it all out.  Set a capacity, price and even a description page. [

![Services](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/11-Services.png "Services")

##### Service Providers

It is not required that you have more than one person available doing what gets done, but if you do, here is where you keep track of them all.  You can even add Additional fees and assign more than one service to a provider.  Even attach them to a Bio page.  _Note: this tab will not populate until you have **at least one** service listed in the Services tab._ [

![Service Providers](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-Service-Providers.png "Service Providers")

 

##### Logs

Keep up with what is happening by checking your Logs.  This nifty tab is where you will find updates on everything that happens on your site.  Status changes, transactions and the like. [

![Logs](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/14-Logs.png "Logs")

##### Shortcodes

Heaps of Shortcodes for your use. Insert provider or client specific tables, dropdown of services, table for appointment scheduling, monthly views, social login pagination, list all upcoming appointments, PayPal and a couple of parameters for those. You can find a complete documentation of shortcodes below or use the visual shortcode generator.  

![image](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/generate_image_preview.png)



## Appointments+ Shortcode Reference

With Appointments+, we have now added a handy shortcode generator, located above the WordPress text editor in visual mode, that allows you to simply select your requirements for the calendar you wish to display, and then be provided with the exact shortcode to use.

However, some of us still like to do things the old fashioned way, and create our shortcodes by hand, so we have included all of the current shortcodes in this handy guide for your reference and reading pleasure.
